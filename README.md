# TCP-IP-Firewall
This is a TCP-IP firewall that is created using Netfilterqueue and Scapy. 

You will require to run a VM or use a package collector in order to block the packets. 
You can block packets coming from certain addresses, ports, block spammers/DDOS-ers, or block prefixes.

You will need the following python libraries : 
1. Scapy - Decode Packets
2. NetFilterQueue as it provides access to packets matched by an iptables rule in Linux

A video has been attached to show the working of the entire project. You can contact me on LinkedIn if any doubts arise. 

You are free to use this code.
